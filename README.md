<b>Walkthrough Video</b>

This is a tutorial to setup this Java application. An integration with Emotiv EEG headset - Insight and its SDK to send RESTful POST calls to a ServiceNow instance. Essentially, utilizing your cognitive thoughts to create an action that generates an incident ticket in ServiceNow.

<b>Assumptions</b> 

You are a developer and/or have a working knowledge of a Java IDE tool coding with Java, REST APIs, and JSON formatting. This Java application is not exclusive to any one platform, but ServiceNow is my playground and the environment that I’m in day and day out. My App. EmoTitan has no UI it is all code based. I’m leaving the UI design creativity to you the developers! :D This is just the fundamentals to get you started in understanding the Emotiv APIs that I worked with. I’m very excited to share the work I’ve done I hope you find it useful and/or inspire to create something on your own and it.

<b>Emotiv website and GitHub</b>

There are a few things that you’re going to need for this integration if you haven’t already you will need to head over to Emotiv and get an EEG headset. I used the Emotiv insight and if your setup/workstation does not have Bluetooth you may need to purchase USB receiver which you can purchase from Emotiv as well. You also need the Xavier control panel application as well as the emulator Xavier composer. The emulator is quite handy when you do not want to wear the headset all the time when testing. The composer can be downloaded from the Emotiv GitHub under tools and/or it comes with the Xavier control panel download from the Emotiv Site. The versions that I’m using is 3.3.3 of both applications. I encourage you to get an understanding of how the Emotiv applications and the EEG  headset work before attempting this integration, things will go smoother in my opinion. 

PS

<b>Note: This IDE setup is for macOS and Windows 7 /10</b>
